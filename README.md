# sentiment-analysis
Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in a piece of text, such as a sentence, paragraph, or document. The goal of sentiment analysis is to understand whether the text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
